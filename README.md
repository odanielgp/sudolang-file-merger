# sudolang-file-merger

This Python code provides a user-friendly interface for merging multiple text files into a single XML file format that complies with the Sudo Lang requirements for including files in an instruction or prompt. The code is designed to be run in a Google Colab environment.

The main functionality of the code is as follows:

1. File Upload:
   - The user is presented with an "Upload Files" button.
   - Upon clicking the button, the user can select multiple text files to upload.
   - The uploaded files are stored in a dictionary, with the file names as keys and file contents as values.

2. File Processing:
   - After the files are uploaded successfully, the "Process Files" button becomes enabled.
   - When the user clicks the "Process Files" button, the code processes the uploaded files.
   - Each file is converted into an XML structure, with the file name as the `<source>` element and the file content as the `<document_content>` element.
   - The XML structures for each file are stored in a list.

3. XML Structure Generation:
   - The code then generates the complete XML structure by combining the individual file XML structures.
   - The XML structures are joined together and wrapped with the `<documents>` root element.
   - The generated XML structure is displayed in the output area of the user interface.

4. File Download:
   - After the XML structure is generated, the "Download XML" button becomes enabled.
   - When the user clicks the "Download XML" button, the code initiates the download of the generated XML file.
   - The XML file is saved with the name "merged_files.xml" and automatically downloaded through the Colab interface.

The code utilizes the IPython widgets library to create an interactive user interface. The interface consists of the following components:
- Title label: Displays the title of the application.
- Upload Files button: Allows the user to select and upload text files.
- Process Files button: Initiates the processing of uploaded files and generates the XML structure.
- Download XML button: Enables the user to download the generated XML file.
- Output area: Displays relevant messages and the generated XML structure.
